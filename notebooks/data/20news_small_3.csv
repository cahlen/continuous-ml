There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.  This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.  Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.  --  Gary Korenek   (korenek@ferranti.com) Network Management Technology Incorporated (formerly Ferranti International Controls Corp.)

Jacking up the frame some more (had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden  platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together.  The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine... I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.  Flipped the bottom spring and then...  >>Is this a nightmare waiting to happen, or an easy, though physically >>demanding, thing to do? > >Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-) >(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly >difficult.)  I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a 1911A1 ...  A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of torque spec ...  It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.   Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a  break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must  have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move  it back... hmmm...).  After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.  BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for. At least it now sits level..  --   E.

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.  Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully.  > Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department  --  Don Lowe, Department of Physics, Monash University,  Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 3168.",soc.religion.christian

For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.   If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.  Jeff.",alt.atheism

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many >fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive >contamination.         Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal  pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.       John Nagle",sci.electronics

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8"" wide.  The dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

After a few down years, the A.L. East is back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O's and the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As for the Rockies, who knows?    The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never forget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team intact.  My predicted finish: 1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion) 2. NY Yankees 3. Toronto 4. Milwaukee 5. Detroit 6. Boston 7.

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no ""option"" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an ""option.""     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.  -Hades",comp.sys.mac.hardware

If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely ""ON""  at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or  less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is  used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to  experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.   >An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed >by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the >center of the sphere.

Therefore, ""the right  >of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well  >regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".    Ah, clarification by obfuscation.  Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state"" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.   >So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties and >Rights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in >the matter of ""Liberties and Rights"" is the final word.

The True Celebration is Easter, the Resurrection of Our Lord.  This has been true from the foundation of the world.  Pagan practices are then either:  1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection,     in which dim light was shone forth so that people would    recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR  2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not    recognize the truth when it was manifested.  I don't believe the second argument, because I believe in the power of the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope. Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glass darkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect. So what? Our understnding of God is today imperfect, for we are not yet perfected.

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise ""disposable needlesused here."" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too ""sharp"" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to ""slide"" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical ""shot."" when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to ""squeeze"" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that  haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap ""terrorists and drug dealers"" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.

What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it.  >Amanda Walker    PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail    Eli   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu",sci.crypt

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.

The optoisolator is a 4N35. On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor of 47k.  It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz. This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not doing anything high-speed.

"From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: etymology of ""Easter"" Lines: 53  for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning ""Passover."" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply ""Spring Festival.""  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in ""Die Sprach,"" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as ""hebdomada alba"" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as ""albae."" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of ""alba,"" meaning ""dawn."" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for ""dawn."" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.   Yours,  James Kiefer   [No, I'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it.  --clh]",soc.religion.christian

(was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption) Organization: Computer Science Dept, Indiana University Distribution: na Lines: 57  This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one.  I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).  --- swh, 20apr93",comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

It is much easier to be an element of change  Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.  >or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates >a new situation.

"From: buenneke@monty.rand.org (Richard Buenneke) Subject: DC-X Rollout Report X-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest Organization: [via International Space University] Original-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU Distribution: sci Lines: 124   McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X          HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better, faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our parents' time.""          ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.""          SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction we're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government investments.""          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope"" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.          The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has a technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.",sci.space
